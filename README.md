# Electronics Inventory Management

This is going to replace both the [Windows](https://github.com/Daxxn/DatasheetViewer) and [Linux](https://github.com/Daxxn/LinuxDatasheetViewer) apps.

### Design Considerations

* Manage parts from a database.
* Link the datasheet for the component.
* Search and sort parts by name, tag, or manufacturer.

### Planned Features

* PDF viewer built into the client.
* Save datasheet to the database if desired.
* Customizable organization

#### Commentary

 This is a long time in the making. I've been chipping away at learning web dev for the better part of a year and I think its to the point where I can make this work. The requirements for a minimum-viable app looks doable. Theres alot to do but it doesn't look impossible anymore.

## Getting Started

### Installation

*(WIP)*

> * Fork the repo and open in the terminal.
> * `npm install` for the server and the client.
>
> starting the Server:
> > * create the `.env` file.
> > * start: `npm run dev`
>
> Starting the Client:
> > * start: `npm run start`
